What I did:

Copied three zip files from my computer to yours. Everything is on
your Desktop under the folder "Software".


Attempted to install ArcGIS -- failed.

Found out that the file I had downloaded was a "crack" and not actual
installation media. The idea is that you're to already have a trial
version or ArcGIS installed, then use this crack to activate it.

I didn't have time to do this (nor could I find a way to install a
trail version -- maybe you can get one?); anyway, I left you with the
crack file, so if you ever get a change to try it, I can walk you
through the process. This is very industry specific software, so it's
hard to pirate; you might have to just buy it.


Attempted to install MS Office -- failed.

The first installation was blocked because your computer said it had a
virus; did it? I don't know. The second version was an ISO, so I
installed Daemon tools (a free application used to work with ISOs).

-- At this point your battery died --

So, here's what you can do (when you get some power):

  * Open DAEMON Tools Lite
  * Hit the CD with the green plus sign to "add a new image"
  * Navigate to the ISO file under 
    Desktop\Software\ms_office\MS_Office07\office07_2 and select it
  * At this point it should appear in the top half of the window
  * Click on it
  * Hit the CD with the green play sign to "mount it"
  * It should ask you to run setup.exe
  * Say yes
  * This should run the office installer

Will it work? I don't know.

You'll have to repeat the above for adobe with one difference: Adobe
requires like 5 disks to finish the install. Repeat the above with the
first disk image -- this will run the installer. During the installation
it'll probably say something like "Please insert the next disk", this is
when you'll repeat the above for the next disc. The installer should
recognize it and continue on its own.

Sorry I couldn't go further.
