#
# a comparison of aur helper times between aurget v1, v2, and packer
#
# i was just using packer as a benchmark as i rewrote aurget v1 into
# v2. i think i did alright.
#
# tests performed on my c2q with broadband access round about 3PM on a
# tuesday.
#
# test 1: resolve all deps and present targets for bin32-wine on my 64
#         bit system as that would require alot of dep handling.
#
# test 2: search aur for "python" as this returns 1118 results so is a
#         good test of JSON parsing methods.
#
# i ran the test 2/3 times per helper and listed the best times from
# each
#
# results: fastest to slowest was aurget v2, packer, aurget v1
#
